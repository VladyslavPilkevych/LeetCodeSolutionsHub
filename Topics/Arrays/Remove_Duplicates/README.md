### Problem Description
[Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/top-interview-questions-easy/92/array/727/)

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then, return the number of unique elements in `nums`.

### Instructions

Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`. To get accepted, you need to do the following:

1. Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially.
2. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
3. Return `k`.
